        The history of yoga is ancient and deeply rooted in the cultural and spiritual traditions of India. The practice of yoga has evolved over thousands of years, and its origins can be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilization, one of the world's oldest civilizations, around 3300â€“1300 BCE. Here's an overview of the historical development of yoga:
        </p>
        <dl>Pre-Classical Period (Before 500 BCE):</dl>
            <dd>
                <li>The earliest evidence of yogic practices comes from the archaeological findings of the Indus Valley Civilization. Seals depicting figures in yogic postures suggest that some form of meditation and ritualistic practices were part of the culture.</li>
                <li>The Vedas, ancient sacred texts of India, contain hymns and rituals that show early contemplative and devotional practices. However, the systematic philosophy and techniques of yoga as we know them today began to take shape in the later Vedic period.</li></dd>
        <dl>Classical Period (500 BCE - 800 CE):</dl>
            <dd>
                <li>The classical period of yoga is marked by the compilation of several foundational texts that laid the groundwork for the philosophy and practices of yoga. The two most influential texts are the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.</li>
                <li>The Bhagavad Gita, a part of the Indian epic Mahabharata, discusses the paths of devotion, knowledge, and disciplined action, all of which are relevant to the practice of yoga.</li>
                <li>The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, written around the 2nd century BCE, is a key text that outlines the philosophy of classical yoga and provides a systematic guide to spiritual practice. Patanjali's eightfold path (Ashtanga Yoga) includes ethical principles, physical postures (asanas), breath control (pranayama), and meditation.</li>
            </dd>
        <dl>Post-Classical Period (800 CE - 1700 CE):</dl>
            <dd>
                <li>During this period, various schools of thought and practices emerged, each interpreting and expanding upon the principles outlined in earlier texts.</li>
                <li>Hatha Yoga, a branch of yoga that emphasizes physical postures, breath control, and meditation, became prominent. Hatha Yoga texts, such as the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, were written to guide practitioners in the physical and energetic aspects of yoga.</li>
            </dd>
        <dl>Modern Period (Late 19th Century Onward):</dl>
            <dd>
                <li>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, yoga underwent a revival and transformation in India, largely influenced by figures like Swami Vivekananda, who introduced yoga to the West during the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893.</li>
                <li>In the mid-20th century, yoga gained popularity in the West through the efforts of prominent figures like B.K.S. Iyengar, Pattabhi Jois, and others who developed their own styles of yoga and spread its practice globally.</li>
                <li>Today, yoga is practiced worldwide in various forms, including Hatha, Vinyasa, Ashtanga, Kundalini, and more, with an emphasis on physical fitness, mental well-being, and spiritual growth.</li>
            </dd>
            <p>
                Throughout its long history, yoga has evolved and adapted to different cultural and historical contexts, making it a versatile and enduring practice. While it has ancient roots, its principles continue to resonate with people seeking holistic well-being in the modern world.
