        <!-- In CSS, the white-space property is used to control how whitespace is handled within an element. The white-space property can take several values, each affecting the rendering of whitespace differently. Here are the common values for the white-space property:

normal:

This is the default value.
Whitespace is collapsed, and line breaks are treated as a space.
css
Copy code
white-space: normal;


nowrap:

Whitespace is collapsed, and text does not wrap to the next line.
css
Copy code
white-space: nowrap;


pre:

Whitespace is preserved, and text does not collapse.
Line breaks and spaces are maintained.
css
Copy code
white-space: pre;


pre-line:

Whitespace is preserved, but line breaks are normalized to a single space.
css
Copy code
white-space: pre-line;


pre-wrap:

Whitespace is preserved, and text wraps to the next line if necessary.
css
Copy code
white-space: pre-wrap;


break-spaces:

Whitespace is preserved, and text wraps to the next line, breaking at spaces.
css
Copy code
white-space: break-spaces;
These values control how whitespace characters (like spaces, tabs, and line breaks) are handled within the element. Choosing the appropriate white-space value depends on the specific requirements of your layout and the desired appearance of your text.

Example usage:

css
Copy code
/* Preserve whitespace and wrap text */
.element {
    white-space: pre-wrap;
}
